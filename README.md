ETL Data Pipeline Project
This project demonstrates the creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Python. The pipeline extracts raw data from various sources, processes and transforms it to clean and structured formats, and finally loads it into a relational database for further analysis. The pipeline ensures data consistency, handles missing values, and performs transformations like categorizing age groups. It uses libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and SQLAlchemy to interact with a MySQL database. The final dataset is optimized for analytics and reporting.
